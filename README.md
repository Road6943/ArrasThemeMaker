This is Version 2.0 of my Arras Theme Maker.

I added in html color selectors to make it easier for casual players to make their own themes, but some browsers and computers may not have feautures like hex code inputs or even color selectors at all (*cough* Safari *cough*) , so I still have my old Google Sheets Theme Maker availiable at this link:
